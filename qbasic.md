WHAT IS QBASIC?

- Its is a programming language.

Confused? No problem.

- Programming language is just like the language we speak.

For example:
There is a pen in the table.
Now you want your brother to bring that pen to you.
What will you do?
=> You will just say: “Hey brother, bring that pen to me”.
See? That's how easy it is?

Now let's think about a computer.
You have computer in your desk and you want it to open a file.
What will you do?
=> You will just say: “Hey computer, open that file”.

But wait, will that work?
Haha, it won't work because that's not how computer works.
=> You need to move your mouse and click on the file.
Then the computer will understand that you want to open that file.
This is how programming is done.

Just like you have grammar in english language
Programming language also has some rules.
And that's called SYNTAX.

Programming is a way more easier than you think.

## CLS

CLear Screen
If you want your friend to rub the board in your class, what will you say?
=> "Hey friend, clear the board"
But for computer, => you will just write CLS
No matter where, but whenever you write CLS, the computer will clear the screen for you.

## PRINT STATEMENT

Think PRINT as your PEN 🖊️

What does a pen do?
It writes!
Just like the pen PRINT is the only thing that writes on the screen.

Example:
PRINT "Hello"

What will happen if you run this program?
The computer will write:
Hello

Ok now let's try to write a program.
Your task is:

1. First Clear the screen
2. Tell computer to write your name

ANSWER:
CLS
PRINT "Write my name"

What will be the result when you run this program?
Computer always reads line by line.

So, what is the first line?
CLS => Computer will clear the screen. Then line 1 is finished.

What is the second line?
PRINT "Write my name"
=> Computer will write "Write my name" on the screen.

You see? Computer will just follow the command you give.
Instead of writing "Sanjaya Acharya" It will write "Write my name".

So, be careful when giving commands.
Give it properly so the computer will understand what exactly you want.

So, the correct program is:
CLS
PRINT "Sanjaya Acharya"

This is how you write a program.

## VARIABLES

Think VARIABLE as a box 📦

Why do we use boxes at home? => To store things!

Now Think about your kitchen

You have 3 jars 🍶.
All of them are red.
One has sugar.
One has salt.
One has pepper.

Now, How do you know which jar contains what?
Simple! You just put labels on them!

Variable is also a label.
Box is variable.
And the label is the name of that variable.

Example:
x = 5
=> x is a box which has 5 in it.

sugar = 100
=> sugar is a box which has 100 in it.

marks = 90
=> marks is a box which has 90 in it.

TASK:
Create 3 VARIABLES and STORE 10, 20, 30 in them.

GOOD ANSWER:
a = 10
b = 20
c = 30

BETTER ANSWER:
rupees = 10
age = 20
rollNumber = 30

Why is this better?
Because the name of the variable is meaningful.

---

## RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES

Can you give a random name to a variable?
Yes!
Instead of writing rupees = 10,
you can also write:
sadfhjk = 10
And guess what? It will work without any problem.
But when you write this kind of program it is so hard to understand what is going on.

So,
Rule 1:
ALWAYS USE MEANINGFUL NAMES FOR VARIABLES

Can you write 123 as a variable name?
Noooooo!
if 123 is a variable name which contains 5 in it, then how will it look?
=> 123 = 5
Is it good?
of course not!

So, Rule 2
Variable name NEVER start with a number

But after alphabet, you can use numbers.
Example:
age1 = 10
age2 = 20
But you can't write 1age = 10.

1age = 10 ❌
age1 = 10 ✔️

Rule 3:
Do not use space or any other symbols

my marks = 50 ❌
myMarks = 50 ✔️
age 1 = 10 ❌
age1 = 10 ✔️
@$# = 40 ❌

## NUMBERS AND STRINGS

What is a number? => 1, 2, 10, 100, 90, 9999
We all know what a number is.

Let's move on to strings.
ANYTHING THAT IS BETWEEN DOUBLE QUOTES IS A STRING.
".............................." => This is a string.
"abcdef" => This is also a string.

"123" => now tell me is it a number or string?
=> Of course its a string.
Because ANYTHING, Literally ANYTHING can be a string when it is surrounded by " "

Now heres a MOST IMPORTANT thing:
We are humans we can figure it out whether it is a number or string.
But for computer, they can't.
so inorder to tell the computer, you need to give $ sign after every variable names.

Examples:
price = "50 rupees" ❌
price$ = "50 rupees" ✔️

name = "Ramesh" ❌
name$ = "Ramesh" ✔️

---

## PRINTING VARIABLES

Example:
x = 10
PRINT x
=> Output: 10

name$ = "Ram"
PRINT name$
=> Output: Ram
